\section{Convenience...}
\ldots always wins. To keep \LaTeX files under version control and edit
them in any editor is something I find convenient. On the other hand,
I find it inconvenient to edit code in a browser and keep Wordpress
posts under version control. Furthermore, converting \LaTeX code 
to HTML is also inconvenient\ldots on a good day. But for technical
articles I prefer \LaTeX over HTML any day.

\emph{Nobby} and \emph{Nobby2WP} are my solutions to reclaim the
convenience I desire. \emph{Nobby} converts \LaTeX articles to HTML
and \emph{Nobby2WP} uploads them to a Wordpress server. Needless to
say, I wrote this entire post in \LaTeX (the source code is
\href{https://github.com/olitheolix/nobby/blob/master/demo/demo.tex}{here})
and used \emph{Nobby} and \emph{Nobby2WP} to publish it.

There is no one-size-fits-all with \LaTeX $\to $ HTML converters.
Use the demonstrations below to determine if \emph{Nobby} suits your
needs. Alternatively, or grab the source code from
\href{https://github.com/olitheolix/nobby}{GitHub} and try it
for yourself.

\emph{Note:} I will not cover the \emph{Nobby2WP} program here. See
the \href{https://github.com/olitheolix/nobby}{project description}
for a brief example instead.

\section{Formatting}
\label{sec:one}
Here is Pythagoras' theorem in an \emph{align} environment:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:pyth}
  z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\end{align}
Here it is again as an inline formula: $z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

Nobby automatically escapes the <> characters. It is therefore safe to
write <strong> or </strong> without accidentally inserting HTML tags.

Similarly, Nobby also translate quotes: ``text in quotes'' and
escaped \LaTeX symbols like ``\$'', ``\{``, ``\}'' and ``\%'' to
proper HTML, ie. without the leading backslash.

You can, of course, \emph{emphasise} something or make a
\textbf{bold} statement.

Inline math expressions like $x=1$ or $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ work fine too.

Here is some plain text. {{This sentence is actually an SVG image.}}

Many \LaTeX macros have equivalents in HTML, for instance
\texttt{\textbackslash{ldots}}. Nobby features a plugin system to
control the conversion. A default plugin for
\texttt{\textbackslash{ldots}} already exists\ldots

As with some macros, many \LaTeX fonts have HTML equivalents too. Once
again it is up to plugins to create the correct HTML tags like
the \texttt{typewriter font}, for instance.

\subsection{Environments}
Nobby does not know about \LaTeX macros or environments. It converts
them to images unless a plugin exists for them. The following examples
demonstrate some of the default plugins.

\subsubsection{Itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rel}
  E = mc^2.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Theorem Environments}
The AMS package provides way to define theorem environments with
\texttt{\textbackslash{newtheorem\{theorem\}\{Theorem\}}}. Nobby
assumes that ``lemma'', ``theorem'', ``example'', ``corollary'' and
``definition'' are defined the document preamble. The HTML conversion
will fail if not.

Nobby ships with a single plugin to handle all these theorem
environments. Here are some examples.

Compare the quality of this version with the 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem}{original} on
Wikipedia).
\begin{theorem}[Divergence Theorem]
  \label{thm:div}
  Suppose $\mathcal{V}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (in the case of
  $n=3$, $\mathcal{V}$ represents a volume in 3D space) which is
  compact and has a piece wise smooth boundary $\mathcal{S}$ (also
  indicated with $\partial\mathcal{V} = \mathcal{S}$). If $F$ is a
  continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighbourhood
  of $\mathcal{V}$, then we have
  \begin{align}
    \iiint_{\mathcal{V}} \nabla \cdot F(\mvec{v})\; \textnormal{d}\mvec{v}
    = \oint_{\mathcal{S}} F(\mvec{s})\; \textnormal{d}\mvec{s}.
  \end{align}
\end{theorem}

Another one from \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence}{Wikipedia}:
\begin{definition}[Divergence in Cartesian Coordinates]
  \label{def:div}
  Let $x, y, z$ be a system of Cartesian coordinates in 3-dimensional
  Euclidean space, and let $i, j, k$ be the corresponding basis of unit
  vectors. The divergence of a continuously differentiable vector
  field $F = U i + V j + W k$ is equal to the scalar-valued function:
  \begin{align}
    \textnormal{div } F = \nabla \cdot F = 
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} +
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} +
    \frac{\partial W}{\partial z}.
  \end{align}
\end{definition}

Here is yet another definition from Wikipedia to demonstrate the
continuous enumeration of theorem environments and equations
therein. The definition also references its own equations. The
following definition of the Laplacian is from
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator}{here}.
\begin{definition}[Laplace Operator]
  \label{def:lap}
  The Laplace operator is a second order differential operator in the
  $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, defined as the divergence
  $(\nabla\cdot)$ of the gradient $(\nabla f)$. Thus if $f$ is a
  twice-differentiable real-valued function, then the Laplacian of $f$
  is defined by
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:lapdef1}
    \Delta f = \nabla^2f = \nabla\cdot\nabla f
  \end{align}
  where the latter notations derive from formally writing $\nabla =
  \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \ldots,
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right)$. Equivalently, the Laplacian
  of $f$ is the sum of all the unmixed second partial derivatives in the
  Cartesian coordinates
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:lapdef2}
    \Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i^2}
  \end{align}
  As a second-order differential operator, the Laplace operator maps
  $C^k$-functions to $C^{k-2}$-functions for $k\geq 2$. The expression
  (\ref{eq:lapdef1}) (or equivalently (\ref{eq:lapdef2})) defines an
  operator $\Delta : C^k(\mathbb{R}^n) \mapsto
  C^{k-2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, or more generally an operator $\Delta :
  C^k(\Omega) \mapsto C^{k-2}(\Omega)$ for any open set $\Omega$.
\end{definition}

You can numerically reference Theorem \ref{thm:div}, Definition
\ref{def:div} and Definition \ref{def:lap} as usual. Alternatively,
you may also reference them with the \texttt{\textbackslash{hyperref}}
macro and link directly to the \hyperref[thm:div]{Divergence Theorem},
the \hyperref[def:div]{Definition of Divergence}, or the
\hyperref[def:div]{Definition of the Laplacian}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:no_largest_int}
  There is no largest integer.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose there were a largest integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Then it must
  be true that $n > n'\;\forall n'\in\mathbb{N}$ yet $n' = n + 1$
  is larger than $n$. This contradicts the supposition. There is hence
  no largest integer.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Comments}
Nobby also converts \LaTeX comments to HTML. You cannot see those
comments because, well, they are comments, alright. To see them anyway
switch to the source code view in your browser.
% By the way, Nobby also converts LaTeX comments to HTML.

\section{Referencing}
\label{sec:ref}
Nobby supports references via the standard \texttt{\textbackslash{href}}
command. This works for equations, sections, tables, figures, and
more.

For instance, here is a numbered reference to Pythagoras' theorem
(\ref{eq:pyth}) and Einstein's famous formula (\ref{eq:rel}).

You may also use the \texttt{\textbackslash{hyperref}} command to
create named links to reference the formulae of
\hyperref[eq:pyth]{Pythagoras} and \hyperref[eq:rel]{Einstein}.

Next are some examples of referenced sections.

\subsection{Sub-Section}
\label{ss:1}
This is sub-Section \ref{ss:1} inside Section \ref{sec:ref}.

\subsubsection{Sub-Sub-Section}
\label{sss:1}
This is sub-sub-Section \ref{sss:1} inside sub-Section \ref{ss:1} and
Section \ref{sec:ref}. The \texttt{\textbackslash{hyperref}} also
works. For instance, you can link to the \hyperref[sec:ref]{main section}.

\subsubsection*{Starred Sub-Sub-Section}
Nobby also supports starred sections.

\section{Figures and Tables}
Here is a floating table. Whereas  \LaTeX would put it at a visually
pleasing position, Nobby puts it right where it was defined.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}
    & $\frac{\pi}{6}$& $\frac{\pi}{4}$& $\frac{\pi}{2}$ & $\pi$\\[1mm]
    \hline
    \rule{0cm}{4mm}$\sin(\phi)$& $\frac{1}{2}$ & $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$& $1$ & $0$\\
    \rule{0cm}{4mm}$\cos(\phi)$& $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ & $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$& $0$&$-1$
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Floating table}
\end{table}

A conventional figure environment that uses the
\texttt{\textbackslash{subcaption}} package. The code and figures for
the next example are from the
\href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions}{Wikimedia}
on \LaTeX. Note that the image is a PNG (hence the coarser appearance)
because the inclusion of the three other images exceeds the image size
threshold (you can adjust it in Nobby's \texttt{config.py} file).\\
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gull}
    \caption{A gull}
    \label{fig:gull}
  \end{subfigure}%
  ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad etc.
  % (or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tiger}
    \caption{A tiger}
    \label{fig:tiger}
  \end{subfigure}
  ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad etc.
  % (or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mouse}
    \caption{A mouse}
    \label{fig:mouse}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Pictures of animals}\label{fig:animals}
\end{figure}

Here is Figure \ref{fig:gull} by itself. Note that the counter in the
figure caption increased (as expected).
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gull}
  \caption{The gull by itself.}

\section{TikZ Image}
