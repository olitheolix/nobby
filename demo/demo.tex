\section*{Convenience\ldots}
\ldots always wins. Writing technical articles in \LaTeX, keeping them
under version control, and editing them in your favourite editor is
convenient, whereas editing code in a browser, writing technical
articles in HTML, or keeping Wordpress under version control is not;
at least not for me. And converting \LaTeX  code to HTML is
inconvenient \ldots on a good day.

\emph{Nobby} and \emph{Nobby2WP} are my tools to get that convenience.
\emph{Nobby} converts \LaTeX articles to HTML
and \emph{Nobby2WP} uploads them to a Wordpress server. Needless to
say I wrote this entire post in \LaTeX, used \emph{Nobby} for the
HTML conversion, and published it with \emph{Nobby2WP} on this very page. Feel
free to inspect the 
\href{https://github.com/olitheolix/nobby/blob/master/demo/demo.tex}{source
code} for this post or read it in \href{./demo.pdf}{PDF} form.

\emph{Disclaimer:} when it comes to \LaTeX $\to $ HTML converters no
one size fits all. Consider this post a demonstration of
\emph{Nobby's} abilities to help you decide if it may be for you. If not,
here are some alternatives you may want to consider:
\href{http://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/latex-to-wordpress/}{latex2wp},
\href{http://physicspages.com/tag/latex2wp/}{Lyx2Wordpress},
\href{http://www.latex2html.org/}{latex2html},
\href{http://plastex.sourceforge.net/}{PlasTeX} and
\href{http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/snuggletex/documentation/overview-and-features.html}{SnuggleTeX}.

For more information about Nobby visit its
\href{https://github.com/olitheolix/nobby}{GitHub page} or read the
\href{https://olitheolix.com/doc/nobby}{documentation}.

\emph{Note:} This article does not cover \emph{Nobby2WP}. See 
\href{https://github.com/olitheolix/nobby}{project description}
for a brief example instead.

\section{Formatting}
\label{sec:one}
Here is Pythagoras' theorem in an \emph{align} environment:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:pyth}
  z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\end{align}
Here it is again as an inline formula: $z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

Nobby automatically escapes the <> characters. You may therefore
write <strong> or </strong> without accidentally inserting HTML tags.
Furthermore, Nobby translate quotation characters (eg ``text in quotes'') and
escaped \LaTeX symbols like ``\$'', ``\{``, ``\}'' and ``\%'' to proper HTML,
ie without the leading backslash.

You can, of course, \emph{emphasise} something or make a
\textbf{bold} statement by using the standard \LaTeX
\texttt{\textbackslash{emph}} and \texttt{\textbackslash{textbf}} commands.

Inline math expressions like $x=1$ or $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ work fine too.

You can also force Nobby to render normal text via \LaTeX by putting it into
double braces: {{This is actually an SVG image.}}

Many \LaTeX macros have equivalents in HTML, for instance
\texttt{\textbackslash{ldots}}. Nobby features a plugin system to
control the macro conversion. For instance, there is already a plugin for
\texttt{\textbackslash{ldots}} so you can already use it\ldots no need to write
it yourself.

Likewise, some \LaTeX fonts have HTML equivalents as well. Since font changes
in \LaTeX are also only macros Nobby's plugin system already covers them too,
for instance to produce the \texttt{typewriter font}.

\subsection{Environments}
Nobby knows how to recognise \LaTeX macros and environments, but not what they
mean. Whenever it finds a macro or environment it looks for an associated
plugin. If no such plugin exists then it passes the code verbatim to \LaTeX and
inserts the result as an image into the HTML page.

In this section I will demonstrate some of the default plugins for frequently
used environments.

\subsubsection{Itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rel}
  E = mc^2.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Theorem Environments}
The AMS package provides a way to define theorem environments with
\texttt{\textbackslash{newtheorem\{theorem\}\{Theorem\}}}. Nobby
assumes that ``lemma'', ``theorem'', ``example'', ``corollary'' and
``definition'' are defined in the document preamble. The HTML conversion
will fail if not.

Nobby ships with a single plugin to handle all theorem
environments. Here are some examples.

Here is a theorem from
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem}{Wikipedia} 
(compare Nobby's and Wikipedia's version in terms of quality!).
\begin{theorem}[Divergence Theorem]
  \label{thm:div}
  Suppose $\mathcal{V}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (in the case of
  $n=3$, $\mathcal{V}$ represents a volume in 3D space) which is
  compact and has a piece wise smooth boundary $\mathcal{S}$ (also
  indicated with $\partial\mathcal{V} = \mathcal{S}$). If $F$ is a
  continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighbourhood
  of $\mathcal{V}$, then we have
  \begin{align}
    \iiint_{\mathcal{V}} \nabla \cdot F(\mvec{v})\; \textnormal{d}\mvec{v}
    = \oint_{\mathcal{S}} F(\mvec{s})\; \textnormal{d}\mvec{s}.
  \end{align}
\end{theorem}

A definition from \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence}{Wikipedia}:
\begin{definition}[Divergence in Cartesian Coordinates]
  \label{def:div}
  Let $x, y, z$ be a system of Cartesian coordinates in 3-dimensional
  Euclidean space, and let $i, j, k$ be the corresponding basis of unit
  vectors. The divergence of a continuously differentiable vector
  field $F = U i + V j + W k$ is equal to the scalar-valued function:
  \begin{align}
    \textnormal{div } F = \nabla \cdot F = 
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} +
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} +
    \frac{\partial W}{\partial z}.
  \end{align}
\end{definition}

Here is yet another definition from Wikipedia to demonstrate the continuous
enumeration of environments and equations. Note that the definition references
its own equations (the original is again from
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator}{Wikipedia}).
\begin{definition}[Laplace Operator]
  \label{def:lap}
  The Laplace operator is a second order differential operator in the
  $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, defined as the divergence
  $(\nabla\cdot)$ of the gradient $(\nabla f)$. Thus if $f$ is a
  twice-differentiable real-valued function, then the Laplacian of $f$
  is defined by
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:lapdef1}
    \Delta f = \nabla^2f = \nabla\cdot\nabla f
  \end{align}
  where the latter notations derive from formally writing $\nabla =
  \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \ldots,
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right)$. Equivalently, the Laplacian
  of $f$ is the sum of all the unmixed second partial derivatives in the
  Cartesian coordinates
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:lapdef2}
    \Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i^2}
  \end{align}
  As a second-order differential operator, the Laplace operator maps
  $C^k$-functions to $C^{k-2}$-functions for $k\geq 2$. The expression
  (\ref{eq:lapdef1}) (or equivalently (\ref{eq:lapdef2})) defines an
  operator $\Delta : C^k(\mathbb{R}^n) \mapsto
  C^{k-2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, or more generally an operator $\Delta :
  C^k(\Omega) \mapsto C^{k-2}(\Omega)$ for any open set $\Omega$.
\end{definition}

You can reference Theorem \ref{thm:div}, Definition
\ref{def:div} and Definition \ref{def:lap} with the usual
\texttt{\textbackslash{ref}} macro. Alternatively,
you may also reference them with the \texttt{\textbackslash{hyperref}}
macro and link directly to the \hyperref[thm:div]{Divergence Theorem},
the \hyperref[def:div]{Definition of Divergence}, or the
\hyperref[def:div]{Definition of the Laplacian}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:no_largest_int}
  There is no largest integer.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose there were a largest integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Then it must
  be true that $n > n'$ for all $n'\in\mathbb{N}\setminus\{n\}$. However,
  the choice $n' = n + 1$ is also an integer and larger than $n$. This
  contradicts the assumption that $n$ is the largest integer.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Comments}
Nobby also converts \LaTeX comments to HTML. You cannot see those
comments because, well, they are comments, alright. To see them anyway
switch to the source code view in your browser.
% By the way, Nobby also converts LaTeX comments to HTML.

\section{Referencing}
\label{sec:ref}
Nobby supports references via the standard \texttt{\textbackslash{href}}
command. This works for equations, sections, tables, figures, and
more.

For instance, here is a numbered reference to Pythagoras' theorem
(\ref{eq:pyth}) and Einstein's famous formula (\ref{eq:rel}).

You may also use the \texttt{\textbackslash{hyperref}} command to
create named links to reference the formulae of
\hyperref[eq:pyth]{Pythagoras} and \hyperref[eq:rel]{Einstein}.

Next are some examples of referenced sections.

\subsection{Sub-Section}
\label{ss:1}
This is sub-Section \ref{ss:1} inside Section \ref{sec:ref}.

\subsubsection{Sub-Sub-Section}
\label{sss:1}
This is sub-sub-Section \ref{sss:1} inside sub-Section \ref{ss:1} and
Section \ref{sec:ref}. The \texttt{\textbackslash{hyperref}} also
works. For instance, you can link to the \hyperref[sec:ref]{main section}.

\subsubsection*{Starred Sub-Sub-Section}
Nobby also supports starred sections.

\section{Figures and Tables}
Here is a floating table. \LaTeX would put it at a visually
pleasing position whereas Nobby puts it right where it was defined.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}
    & $\frac{\pi}{6}$& $\frac{\pi}{4}$& $\frac{\pi}{2}$ & $\pi$\\[1mm]
    \hline
    \rule{0cm}{4mm}$\sin(\phi)$& $\frac{1}{2}$ & $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$& $1$ & $0$\\
    \rule{0cm}{4mm}$\cos(\phi)$& $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ & $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$& $0$&$-1$
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Floating table}
\end{table}
\\

Next is a figure environment that uses the \texttt{\textbackslash{subcaption}}
package. The code for this example is from the
\href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions}{Wikimedia}
on \LaTeX. Note that the image is a PNG (hence the coarser appearance)
because Nobby determined that it is too large to be included as an SVG. You can
adjust the threshold where Nobby's switches from SVG to PNG images in
\texttt{config.py} file or on the command line (see \emph{nobby -h} for help).\\
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gull}
    \caption{A gull}
    \label{fig:gull}
  \end{subfigure}%
  ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad etc.
  % (or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tiger}
    \caption{A tiger}
    \label{fig:tiger}
  \end{subfigure}
  ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad etc.
  % (or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mouse}
    \caption{A mouse}
    \label{fig:mouse}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Pictures of animals}\label{fig:animals}
\end{figure}

Here is Figure \ref{fig:gull} by itself. Note that the counter in the
figure caption increased (as expected).
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gull}
  \caption{The gull by itself.}
  \label{fig:gull_alone}
\end{figure}

\section{TikZ Image}
\emph{TikZ} is a popular \LaTeX package for technical drawings. Here is an
\href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/j-curve}{example from their
  webpage}.
